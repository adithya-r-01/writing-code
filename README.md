# Writing Code

Code for my blogs (which can be found [here](https://hiddendatablog.super.site/)). Most of the functionality is written in `python`. This is still very much a _work in progress_ so take the functionality with a grain of salt. Standard operating procedure applies.

If you see a `requirements.txt` file create a virtual environment, most of these scripts will reference a dataset present somewhere in the directory. I plan on cleaning this up a bit when I get time.
